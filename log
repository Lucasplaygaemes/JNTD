The name is self explanatory, This will be my log journey, where i will write all things that i'm changin in the code, it wil be seperated by date, i can't assure it will be 100% precise about
the date, but it will be close.
# Currently README
# JNTD
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence.
And it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, or a missing something.

# Calculator
It was getting dusty in my TODO list, so why not add it here, a calculator, i can't say it's a simple calculator, neither a cientific, so i can't name it now, but it's a calc that will have a lot of options, and one day (Probably this year) it shall be able to interact with the 2B, and may even with 9S. The reason behind me adding it it's because i will not train 2B to do Calculus level equations, so it's should be really good if it was possible to do by hand, even though 2B will be trained to use this app. 

# Delayed Future updates
My next update to the code will add the possibility to automate the webscraping via ScrapeGraphAI, i will make a code in python called scrap, it will atutomate most of the process of webscraping, including sites search, and management of the data acquired. It will be slowly implemented, and will probably be done in about 2 to 3 weeks in maximum.

# 2B and images
2B it's has it's code already implemented but, she isn't ready yet, so my next thing to do will to finish her, for some reasons i will just be able to do this in the next month, and therefore i will need to wait for my next update, that's right, images! I was planning to train she to be able to understand images and graphics, but it may overload her size and specs requeired, so there will be her auxiliator, and his name is 9S! (There a lot of NA references, i just can't not do it).

# 9S!
One day i may have the specs to use the most heavy LLM that i can put my hands on, until there i will need to change my mind to one that i can afford, i was already wating to train more than one AI, and i was't going to need a LLM, because of 2B, so i figured out that i can make 9S too, so i can use both of them. 9S will not have the ability to chat like 2B, it's obvius he will be able to speak with the user, but his function is to read a image text, graphs and figures, and transcribe that to text, or a understandable data tha 2B will be able to use. He is not designed to understand every image, personally, i just wanted him to function like a translator, from him to 2B. 


Almost every time i updated something in the README it will be updated here as well.

# 31/05/2025
Haven't looked in my code for a little, was a bit sad because seeing my commits and change make me feeling that i'm dooing the right thing. I have updatated my calc.c. even though 
it was already done, i forgot to commit it. srry.
One thing i noticed it's my 2b.c code is strange, i may have changed it and forgeting, or i uploaded a wrong version, neither the case, i'm working in my 2bt.c. T stands for tests,
if you may not noticed.
I'm updating my TODO list, because, i want to finish this part of the code as soon as possible, and after that, i will start to proprely work on 2b. I will give to me the time of 2~3
weeks, if im not able to finish it in the time, i will give me more 1 week, and even after that, if im not able to finish or get close to it, i pass it, and use change my TODO again.

Why i'm such a rush? I'm want she to function proprely as soon as possible, the next thing i will do is to make she Jarvis-Like LLM, How?

# Multidevice Usage.
That's right, one of my next projects will be to make she a multidevice usage, it's indubitably that i will have a list of problems, but my life is going to easily, so why not?
Don't be too much excited, remeber i will firts try to make 2b work? That can take up to a month, just of me training she and testing, but i think that's be a marveolus experience.
I will let you guys updated about it. Wish me luck.

Forgot to metion, 2B(JNTD) is getting a Log feature!!!
Beause if you want simply search for errors or something the log will be avaible to you, isn't the best, but it will do it's job

# 02/06/2025
Today i have debugged my code so it's now everything working, 2bt.c and calc.c are 100% working.
Even tought the code has it help settings in Brazilian Portugese, you may recognize the functions by the code it will executed.

# 05/06/2025
I have added the function to run a script, a predefined list of commands, you need to put one by line, and be in the same directory as the code, have added to the mkdir function, but still making the preparations to make it 100%, it already make the folder, but i don't know where, so.
Still thinking about what to add in it, there are some trivial functions but is already thing that existed.
