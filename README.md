# JNTD!
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use?
There's no such thing as "right way to use". Because you can automate things when and how you want, but you should make changes on it according to your needings. There are pre defined commands that you can see on the help part, you can change the code by yourself, have a good idea, want it on the code? make a submission and if it's good, i merge it.

# How it work's?
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence, and it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, when something is missing.

# A2!
What's A2 you might ask? It's my own file editor. The VIM is my main file editor, and that won't change, but when you need to edit a file, or make a correction or whatever reason, the A2 will be there waiting you. It's inspired by vim. A2 isn't perfect yet, but it's working and A2 is working well! The code now has color in the text, and have a documented way where you can study it to help you understand the code.
A2 is now a much more complete then before, you can run linux commands just like vim, and there a new file "c.syntax" and what does that file do you might ask?
Easy! There is the words who will be highlighted and i will add in the future a c.dict that will be a dictionary for words! and the best!

# A2 or JNTD?
Even tought this repo and the main code is JNTD, i'm having a lot of fun adding useful functions in a2, so i'm giving it a lot more attention the JNTD, but i will not do it forever, after i added 
the functions in my TODO list, i will return my focus to JNTD, but i have a lot of cool features to add at JNTD, but even more add a2.c.

# Necessity creates opportunity
My pc left me down, i was making updates to enchace of the issue #14, and because of that, i have lost all the progress from the code, so, i gonna make a new enchancement, a auto-saver.
It's gonna save the file every minute, in a file.sv that you can then reload with the last modifications, it's gonna be deleted everytime you sucessfuly save a file, inspired by Vim.

# CTRL Z Y!
This is nice function, but it was hard to implement even though it really common in text editors and IDE's.

# Multiplatform (again)?
I'm now proudly using FREE BSD, and isn't really nothing special from other linux distros, even though it's not linux. Will use it for some time.
Probably won't be my main OS, but knowing it was all made in C, give it's a special place in my heart.

# Issues!
I'm already doing it, and from now on i will add issues always i have a bug or something i need to fix, to improve terminal workflow, i'm using gh and git, because yet gh don't replace git for me.
I will try to fix then in at max 2 weeks after created, or at least try and add updates about it.

# Dependencies?
Until this moment, i'm only using C, but not just default C libralys, so i will make a file to install dependecies on some systems, which are the one i know, and how to install.

# Projects?
JNTD is my main project for a while now, but i have other projects in mind, my favorite programming language is C, and that's clear, but, i would love somethings that are not native in C, i'm not a c developer,
but i will make changes haha. I have other projects in mind, some of then i can add in JNTD, but other i can't, i will make then public once i feel they're good enough.

# Awrit!
Awrit is a miracle! You can use a browser fully in terminal, just with awrit + Kitty, kitty is a marvelous terminal. I don't own any of those programs, every right goes to the respective owners.

# Multiplatform?
And it's a miracle! The code is "multiplataform", not really, but the code was able to run on my pc. But it's not perfect, nothing is, i need to make some modifications so it can run nice on every platform.

# Repository!
I will make my own repository! and you ask where? In the beloved Github! I will make the repository folder here, on github, it's not the best, but it's what i can do for now. Just like you can download the files from the linux with one command from a repository, any important file will be in the repository.

# Plugins?
And the plugins parts are back, but this time isn't with good news, but i'm making a clean and revision, and unfortunetly with AI help, to debug the code. And i'm not having sucess yet haha.

# Makefile!
The make file compile and make every thing necessary to JNTD, a2 will be added in it.

# Documentation!
I'm going to add a new file, soon, called documentation. Why's that? Simple, the code is written by me, and i really want other people to contribuite on it, so i will make a documentation. So whoever want to add something, make it own plugin, Or anything like will be able because he can read the docs. I will need AI help to implement in the whole code, but i will revise it all by myself. Just forgot to say, the documentation will be in english too.

# Tip's?
I would be really gratefull if you want to improve the code, it's always open to commits. and if you want you can contact me via my email. My email is lucasmoura27271@gmail.com, and if you need to say something with me, we can chat by email.

# Plugins!
You can make you own plugins to JNTD, there is a example of plugins in the plugin folder. The same file is well documented about how you can make your own.

# Repository!
Well, for now, don't suit me making a online repository for "3" plugins. So i'm using this repository, as a repository! It's simple, i think, the official plugins will be here.
Any important file or plugin can and will be possible to download from this repository.

# Readme?
As you may notice, the README file is getting big, and i can't list every new thing neither any changes that i will make in this code.
So i will add a new file, Features, and the name again is selfexplanatory. When a big update or change be made, it will be showed in README for 5~10 days in maximum. In the features file will have all that already is on the readme, and what's not.

# Security?
C isn't the best and most secure language ever, most of it because of the programmer, i'm in that list, i'm trying to make it secure, the most of functions are at least a bit secure, and some are a lot.

# Calculator!
There is a calculator, it's not a scientific calculator but neither a common one, it's between the line, a frined of mine will help me improve it futurely.

# Languages?
As you may noticed, all the README is in english, the commits are in english and Portuguese, and the functions are in portuguese as well. And i need to decide in which one i will make the whole code, so there is the folder en, where is the code with everything in english and explanations as well. The code will have 4 default languages, Brazilian Portuguese, English, Japanese, and maybe Spanish.
