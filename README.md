# JNTD!
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use?
There's no such thing as "right way to use". Because you can automate things when and how you want, but you should make changes on it according to your needings. There are pre defined commands that you can see on the help part, you can change the code by yourself, have a good idea, want it on the code? make a submission and if it's good, i merge it.

# How it work's?
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence, and it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, or a missing something.

# Calculator!
It was getting dusty in my TODO list, so why not add it here, a calculator, i can't say it's a simple calculator, neither a cientific, so i can't name it now, but it's a calc that will have a lot of options, and one day (Probably this year) it shall be able to interact with the 2B, and may even with 9S. The reason behind me adding it it's because even though she will be able to do calculus level equations, i won't put that all on her back, and it's a cool feature so why not add it?.

# Jntd_descri!
It's simple, it will have an explanation of everything in eachline, so you can know what it do, i ain't writting all that by hand, so ai will be used. will be at least close to the newest version. Because of that, it will be big, a lot more, than usual, and theres not to much i can do about it.

# Log!
It's self explanatory, it's a log of the commands send by you, it will be stored in a file called "log.txt", it has the time, and the day the commands was executed, as well theres a history log, but in the code itself, so you can see the last commands, it's redoundant, so i will change it in the future.

# QUIZ!
Now we have a quiz! it's a simple quiz where you answer questions of a varity of themes, and you can edit the questions! All of them are in the quiz.txt file.

# Git!
The git function show you the link to JNTD repository, but the last commit feature, probably just work in my pc, thats because my git is setted to JNTD, but your may not, and that's a problem that i will handle in the future.

# TODO!
Now we have the TODO funcionality, where you can define things, and be remembered when the defined times comes, as you can set it to 0, it's saved in todos.txt. and you can check if one is gone to expire today, and list everyone.

# Languages?
As you may noticed, all the README is in english, the commits are in english and Portuguese, and the functions are in portuguese as well. And i need to decide in which one i will make the whole code, i'm thinking in making a copy of it, and just changing the words from pt to en, and let it in a folder apart, if you want to add it in a another language just commit it in a new folder with that language. I will add only the languages that i know, that will be 3, maybe 4, Portuguese, English, Espanish and Japanese.

# Copy_di
I'm implementing a copy function, but it's a different one, you can copy the content from one file to another. The propely function will be future implemented.

# Multithread!
It's now a real thing! I learning it slowly, but the timer and quiz timer already working.

# VIM!
The VIM is integrated, you can edit a file, create, do everything you normally do with vim inside of it, and the when you exit you will be back in JNTD.

# 9S!
One day i may have the specs to use the most heavy LLM that i can put my hands on, until there i will need to change my mind to one that i can afford, i was already wating to train more than one AI, and i was't going to need a LLM, because of 2B, so i figured out that i can make 9S too, so i can use both of them. 9S will not have the ability to chat like 2B, it's obvius he will be able to speak with the user, but his function is to read a image text, graphs and figures, and transcribe that to text, or a understandable data tha 2B will be able to use. He is not designed to understand every image, personally, i just wanted him to function like a translator, from him to 2B.

# 2B and images!
2B it's has it's code already implemented but, she isn't ready yet, so my next thing to do will to finish her, for some reasons i will just be able to do this in the next month, and therefore i will need to wait for my next update, that's right, images! I was planning to train she to be able to understand images and graphics, but it may overload her size and specs requeired, so there will be her auxiliator, and his name is 9S! (There a lot of NA references, i just can't not do it).
