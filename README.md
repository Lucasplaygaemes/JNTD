# JNTD
This is a simple code where u can automate shell commands on your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence.
And it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, or a missing something.
