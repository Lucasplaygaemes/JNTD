# JNTD!
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use?
There's no such thing as "right way to use". Because you can automate things when and how you want, but you should make changes on it according to your needings. There are pre defined commands that you can see on the help part, you can change the code by yourself, have a good idea, want it on the code? make a submission and if it's good, i merge it.

# How it work's?
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence, and it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, when something is missing.

# Repository!
I will make my own repository! and you ask where? In the beloved Github! I will make the repository folder here, on github, it's not the best, but it's what i can do for now. Just like you can download the files from the linux with one command from a repository, any important file will be in the repository.

# Delay.
I'm sorry guys but i have been out for sometime, taked a time to relax, but i'm back.

# Plugins?
And the plugins parts are back, but this time isn't with good news, but i'm making a clean and revision, and unfortunetly with AI help, to debug the code. And i'm not having sucess yet haha.

# A2!
What's A2 you might ask? It's my own file editor. The VIM is my main file editor, and that won't change, but when you need to edit a file, or make a correction or whatever reason, the A2 will be there waiting you. It's inspired by vim. A2 isn't perfect yet but it's working.
# Makefile!
Theres now a make file where you don't need to compile every single file by hand. But currently it's not working properly.

# Documentation!
I'm going to add a new file, soon, called documentation. Why's that? Simple, the code is written by me, and i really want other people to contribuite on it, so i will make a documentation. So whoever want to add something, make it own plugin, Or anything like will be able because he can read the docs. I will need AI help to implement in the whole code, but i will revise it all by myself. Just forgot to say, the documentation will be in english too.

# Tip's?
I would be really gratefull if you want to improve the code, it's always open to commits. and if you want you can contact me via my email. I will put it somewhere here. My email is lucasmoura27271@gmail.com, and if you need to say something with me, we can chat by email.

# Plugins!
That's a cool things, you can add plugin on it, just put it on the plugins folder. The correct documentantion will be uploaded to how to add one. For now, i haven't make any new plugins, because i'm using fuctions that ware already implemented. The plugin function is now almost 100% working, just a little of adjustment need to be done.

# Curl!
The curl function is now working. The curl functions is also working parially, i have already made a way to download it, i'm just trying to implemente it right. The code will have a improved function to download files. And will make my own repository with plugins to it.

# Repository!
Well, for now, don't suit me making a online repository for "3" plugins. So i'm using this repository, as a repository! It's simple, i think, the official plugins will be here.
Any important file or plugin can and will be possible to download from this repository.

# Readme?
As you may notice, the README file is getting big, and i can't list every new thing neither any changes that i will make in this code.
So i will add a new file, Features, and the name again is selfexplanatory. When a big update or change be made, it will be showed in README for 5~10 days in maximum. In the features file will have all that already is on the readme, and what's not.

# Security?
Until now i wasn't really think in security aspects, because it's a simple code, not much is an issue, thing's like C don't having a garbage collector, and another aspects, but as all good code, mine need to have at least a bit o security. So i'm already implemented some of it, but not much, like, 2b can't run any comands as her like, only the ones that also availble to JNTD. I'm making changes in the ones where they use the system funtcion, but not all can be easily replaced. Not for now, i make my best to do some security improvements.

# Calculator!
There is a calculator, it's not a scientific calculator but neither a common one, it's between the line, a frined of mine will help me improve it futurely.
# Log!
It's self explanatory, it's a log of the commands send by you, it will be stored in a file called "log.txt", it has the time, and the day the commands was executed, as well theres a history log, but in the code itself, so you can see the last commands, it's redoundant, so i will change it in the future.

# Git!
The git function show you the link to JNTD repository, but the last commit feature, probably just work in my pc, thats because my git is setted to JNTD, but your may not, and that's a problem that i will handle in the future.

# TODO!
Now we have the TODO funcionality, where you can define things, and be remembered when the defined times comes, as you can set it to 0, it's saved in todos.txt. and you can check if one is gone to expire today, and list everyone.

# Languages?
As you may noticed, all the README is in english, the commits are in english and Portuguese, and the functions are in portuguese as well. And i need to decide in which one i will make the whole code, i'm thinking in making a copy of it, and just changing the words from pt to en, and let it in a folder apart, if you want to add it in a another language just commit it in a new folder with that language. I will add only the languages that i know, that will be 3, maybe 4, Portuguese, English, Espanish and Japanese.

# Unwanted Delay.
Unfortunately my system has corrupted. I wasn't able to fully recover it, but i was able to recover the most valuable files. However, i'm need to reconfigure my whole system, and i don't think it will take a long time, but if the updates got decrement for the next week, i'm sorry.
