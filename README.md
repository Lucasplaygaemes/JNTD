# JNTD
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence.
And it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, or a missing something.

# Calculator
It was getting dusty in my TODO list, so why not add it here, a calculator, i can't say it's a simple calculator, neither a cientific, so i can't name it now, but it's a calc that will have a lot of options, and one day (Probably this year) it shall be able to interact with the 2B, and may even with 9S. The reason behind me adding it it's because i will not train 2B to do Calculus level equations, so it's should be really good if it was possible to do by hand, even though 2B will be trained to use this app. 

# Delayed Future updates
My next update to the code will add the possibility to automate the webscraping via ScrapeGraphAI, i will make a code in python called scrap, it will atutomate most of the process of webscraping, including sites search, and management of the data acquired. It will be slowly implemented, and will probably be done in about 2 to 3 weeks in maximum.

# 2B and images
2B it's has it's code already implemented but, she isn't ready yet, so my next thing to do will to finish her, for some reasons i will just be able to do this in the next month, and therefore i will need to wait for my next update, that's right, images! I was planning to train she to be able to understand images and graphics, but it may overload her size and specs requeired, so there will be her auxiliator, and his name is 9S! (There a lot of NA references, i just can't not do it).

# 9S!
One day i may have the specs to use the most heavy LLM that i can put my hands on, until there i will need to change my mind to one that i can afford, i was already wating to train more than one AI, and i was't going to need a LLM, because of 2B, so i figured out that i can make 9S too, so i can use both of them. 9S will not have the ability to chat like 2B, it's obvius he will be able to speak with the user, but his function is to read a image text, graphs and figures, and transcribe that to text, or a understandable data tha 2B will be able to use. He is not designed to understand every image, personally, i just wanted him to function like a translator, from him to 2B. 

# Log!
I have maked a file named, log, it's self explanatory what it does, but it will be also my changes and thoughts about the code, what to change, in this journey.
There is not much to talk about it.

# Don't confuse with Log.
Log will be the Log output of 2b(JNTD), log is my personal annotations.
Log â‰  log.
