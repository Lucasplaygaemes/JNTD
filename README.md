# JNTD!
"Just Need To Do", or JNTD is a code where you do, what you need to do, every other problematic or slow thing, let it to JNTD.
This is a simple code where you can automate commands and other tasks in your system.
The objective of this code is let me integrate my own LLM with my system, i haven't finished it yet, but i'm already making the preaparations when i finished her.

# How to use?
There's no such thing as "right way to use". Because you can automate things when and how you want, but you should make changes on it according to your needings. There are pre defined commands that you can see on the help part, you can change the code by yourself, have a good idea, want it on the code? make a submission and if it's good, i merge it.

# How it work's?
The code access the Ollama via bash, the 2B it's trained to know how and what to respond when it's questioned within the terminal, it's has been trained in a personalized dataset, that's has previous commands and interactions between she and the user and the terminal. Ex: make an .txt file that has the firts 50 firts numbers from fibonacci sequence, and it's done.
I want in the next updates make she possible to make complex interactions with the terminal, and codes, she may be possible to execute codes, and test them by herself, so she will have the possibility to know, where, why, and how a bug it's happening, she will also be able to search for directorys that may have a bug, when something is missing.

# LSP
I'm working non-stop in adding a lsp server for c in the past 4 to 5 days, i'm close to make it fully work, i'm about 70% on it.
Next release will be at sunday, probably.
Will try to make it as fast as possible, and fix the most bugs before the next release.
Wish me luck;

# Refactoring!
The code was "refactored" and now is divided in main parts.

# A2!
What's A2 you might ask? It's my own file editor. The VIM is my main file editor, but with the develop of the A2 and it's improvments i'm slowing changing it to be my main editor.
I have added functions that are not present in VIM or any text editor i have used in the past, functions like GCC, or diff, are functions that help my everyday development so i added them.
Every cool feature and more important, useful that comes to my mind, i will try to add it.

# A2 or JNTD?
Even tought this repo and the main code is JNTD, i'm having a lot of fun adding useful functions in a2, so i'm giving it a lot more attention the JNTD, but i will not do it forever, after i added 
the functions in my TODO list, i will return my focus to JNTD, but i have a lot of cool features to add at JNTD, but even more add a2.c.

# Releases!
I will make releases every few days with minor changes, or when big changes are made, i will also make one. Can't say which plataforms it will be deployed. 

# Issues!
I'm already doing it, and from now on i will add issues always i have a bug or something i need to fix, to improve terminal workflow, i'm using gh and git, because yet gh don't replace git for me.
I will try to fix then in at max 2 weeks after created, or at least try and add updates about it.

# Projects?
JNTD is my main project for a while now, but i have other projects in mind, my favorite programming language is C, and that's clear, but, i would love somethings that are not native in C, i'm not a c developer,
but i will make changes haha. I have other projects in mind, some of then i can add in JNTD, but other i can't, i will make then public once i feel they're good enough.

# Multiplatform?
And it's a miracle! The code is "multiplataform", not really, but the code was able to run on my pc. But it's not perfect, nothing is, i need to make some modifications so it can run nice on every platform.

# Plugins?
And the plugins parts are back, but this time isn't with good news, but i'm making a clean and revision, and unfortunetly with AI help, to debug the code. And i'm not having sucess yet haha.

# Makefile!
The make file compile and make every thing necessary to JNTD, a2 will be added in it.

# Documentation!
I'm going to add a new file, soon, called documentation. Why's that? Simple, the code is written by me, and i really want other people to contribuite on it, so i will make a documentation. So whoever want to add something, make it own plugin, Or anything like will be able because he can read the docs. I will need AI help to implement in the whole code, but i will revise it all by myself. Just forgot to say, the documentation will be in english too.

# Tip's?
I would be really gratefull if you want to improve the code, it's always open to commits. and if you want you can contact me via my email. My email is lucasmoura27271@gmail.com, and if you need to say something with me, we can chat by email.

# Plugins!
You can make you own plugins to JNTD, there is a example of plugins in the plugin folder. The same file is documented about how you can make your own.

# Readme?
As you may notice, the README file is getting big, and i can't list every new thing neither any changes that i will make in this code.
So i will add a new file, Features, and the name again is selfexplanatory. When a big update or change be made, it will be showed in README for 5~10 days in maximum. In the features file will have all that already is on the readme, and what's not.
